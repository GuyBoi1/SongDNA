# SongDNA
SongDNA is an AI-powered (Apple Intelligence or ChatGPT) guitar assistant that breaks any song down into its core playing DNA. Just give it a song name or hum the melody, and SongDNA generates video guides, sheet music &amp; tabs, precise electric guitar settings, GarageBand amp setups, and the correct tuning—so you can sound right, instantly. You can either install it and its helper shortcut (What Amp?) using the json files linked or through an icloud link.
